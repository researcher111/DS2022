- Hobbies: Reading spy novels, rock climbing, cooking
- Spyname: Agent Shadow
- About me (Fake): I'm a data science student who's convinced that my cat is actually plotting world domination through strategic nap scheduling. I spend my free time analyzing her sleep patterns and have developed a machine learning model to predict when she'll knock things off my desk. I also make surprisingly good pancakes and have an irrational fear of automatic hand dryers.
